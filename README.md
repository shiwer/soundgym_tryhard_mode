# SoundGym Helper Browser Extension

## Introduction

The SoundGym Helper browser extension is a tool designed to enhance your experience on the [SoundGym](https://www.soundgym.co) website. SoundGym offers various tools to help musicians and audio professionals train their ears and improve their skills. 
As a user, I wanted to keep track on my high score and force myself beating it on my workout.

## Why Use This Extension

Browser extensions are powerful additions that can enhance your web browsing experience. They are lightweight plugins that can add new functionalities to websites. 
This simple extension will create a div to show on your game page your high score. If you haven't beaten your high score then when you get to the game over overlay the page is refreshed and you have to start back practising.



## Getting Started

To get started with the SoundGym Helper extension, follow these steps:

1. **Installation:**
   - Download the folder and install it manually as an unpacked extension.

2. **Usage:**
   - Visit the SoundGym website and start your training routine as usual. Check that you have the Current High Score on your game practise.

3. **Note**
   - For every game you start playing with the add-on set for the first time, the high score will show 0. Then it's going to be updated.
